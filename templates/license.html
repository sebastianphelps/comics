    That is, you don't need my permission to post these pictures on your website (and
    hot-linking with  is fine); just include a link back to this page. You can use them
    freely (with some kind of link) in not-for-profit publications, and I'm also okay with
    people reprinting occasional comics (with clear attribution) in publications like books,
    blogs, newsletters, and presentations. If you're not sure, just
    <a href="mailto:comics@sebastianphelps.com">email me</a> and ask.
